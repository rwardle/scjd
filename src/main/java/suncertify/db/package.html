Provides classes for performing operations on a contractor database.
<p>
    <code>DBMain</code> is a supplied interface that doesn't provide an opportunity to inform
    clients via a checked exception when an IO error has occurred while accessing the database file.
    This forces the use of unchecked exceptions for this purpose in the <code>Data</code> class.

<p>
    The <code>Database</code> interface defines the same methods as <code>DBMain</code> but methods
    that interact with the database file are declared to throw an <code>IOException</code>. The
    <code>DataAdapter</code> class is used to map the unchecked exceptions thrown from
    <code>Data</code> into the checked exceptions declared in the <code>Database</code> interface.

<p>
    Clients of this package are encouraged to user the well-defined <code>Database</code> interface
    for performing database operations rather than <code>DBMain</code>. The database should be
    created by calling the <code>createDatabase</code> method on an implementation of <code>DatabaseFactory</code>
    passing in the path to the database file. In order to prevent database file corruption, only one
    database should be created per database file path.
