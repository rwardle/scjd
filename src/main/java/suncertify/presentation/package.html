Provides classes for displaying the user interface and handling user events. The classes in this
package follow a variation of the Model-View-Presenter pattern where the view delegates user events
to the presenter object and the presenter is also responsible for updating the data in the view
object. This results in most of the view logic being located in the presenter rather than the view -
for this reason the pattern is called <i>Passive View</i>.
